  # Supratmos Landing

  This is a code bundle for Supratmos Landing. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/EEc5a0mfE2dhafPZqZmh7c/Supratmos-Landing.

  ## Running the code

  Run `bun i` or `npm i` to install the dependencies. We added `react-router-dom` — if using npm, run `npm i react-router-dom`.

  Run `npm run dev` or `bun run dev` to start the development server.

  Routes added:
  - `/product` — product registration (protected: login required)
  - `/verify` — verification screen
  - `/login` and `/register` — user auth pages (local demo auth)

  Use `bun i` after updating `package.json` to ensure packages are installed.
